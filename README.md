SPOTIFY CLONE

A **Spotify Clone** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** is a simple web-based music player that mimics the UI and functionality of Spotify. It typically includes features like a navigation bar, playlist display, play/pause controls, volume adjustment, and a responsive design. JavaScript handles the interactivity, such as playing songs, updating the progress bar, and switching tracks. This project is great for practicing **frontend development** and working with **audio elements in JavaScript**. You can check out the **GitHub repository** for the project [here](your-github-repo-link).
